# Coding Test

This tries to be a simple solution to the problem 1 of https://github.com/teamleadercrm/coding-test

I used slim microframework in order to develop this as fast as possible.

You'll need phpunit in order to run the unit tests, you can find the binary in vendor/bin/phpunit just after install the vendors with composer.

There are some TODOS to improve the code in the future.
I hope you enjoy reviewing this as much I enjoyed programming it.
